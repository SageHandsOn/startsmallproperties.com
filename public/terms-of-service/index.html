<h3 id="supplemental-terms-of-use-for-title-iii-regulation-crowdfunding-opportunities">Supplemental terms of use for Title III (Regulation Crowdfunding) opportunities.</h3>
<p>You have expressed interest in one or companies offering securities under section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act of 1933, which was added to the law by the JOBS Act of 2012. We refer to those as “Title III Opportunities.”</p>
<p>These Supplemental Terms of Use for Title III Opportunities – which we refer to as the “Supplemental Terms” – apply to all Title III Opportunities. They supplement, but do not replace the Terms of Use, meaning that you continue to be subject to all of the Terms of Use. However the Supplemental Terms conflict with the Terms of Use, these Supplemental Terms take precedence.</p>
<p>The following definitions apply in these Supplemental Terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The words “Funding Portal,” “we,” or ”us” mean Not So Small Change, LLC.</li>
<li>“You” means you, the prospective investor.</li>
<li>“Site” means the website located at <a href="http://www.smallchange.co/">http://www.smallchange.co/</a>.</li>
<li>“Issuers” means the companies offering securities at the Site under section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act of 1933, which are designated as such at the Site.</li>
<li>“SEC” means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</li>
<li>“FINRA” means the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.</li>
<li>Other capitalized terms have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Use.</li>
</ul>
<p>You agree that:</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy of Information</strong>. All of the information you provide to us will be true and accurate in all respects. If you learn that any of the information you have given to us is incorrect or inaccurate, you will notify us immediately.</p>

<ul>
<li>You cannot purchase securities of Funding Portal on the Site, and you will not acquire any ownership interest in Funding Portal by investing in an Issuer.</li>
<li>Funding Portal does not make any promises, representations, or recommendations about any of the Issuers. You have to decide whether to invest in Issuers on your own, based on information from the Issuers themselves.</li>
