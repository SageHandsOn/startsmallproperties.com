Many website operators have been receiving warning letters for some time now. The transfer of personal data - the plaintiff's IP address - to Google

, due to the dynamic linking of Google Fonts, is the accusation. If you have received such a letter, stay calm and inform yourself in detail before you get upset. The situation is not as threatening as it appears at first glance. Most of the letters currently emerging are obviously mass mailings that come from two people:

*1. Martin Ismail, represented by the lawyer Kilian Lenard from Berlin. Martin Ismail claims to represent the “Data Protection Interest Group”.*

*2. Ms. / Mr. Wang Yu, represented by Digikoros (Greek term for a lawyer) Nikolaos Kairis, Meerbusch.*

**How should I react?**

The first thing you should check is whether you are really linking Google Fonts dynamically on your website. If this is the case, our recommendation is to save the Google Fonts locally on your server and avoid dynamic linking to Google.

In the second step, the question arises as to whether an answer is required for the warning letters? After clarifying the risks, we would currently recommend not responding to the warning letters. The reason for this is very long, but we want to limit ourselves to the three main points:

*1. Causing an alleged legal violation*

Given the large number of warnings - one can assume based on the warning letters that there are seven figures - it hardly seems possible that the data for the warnings is collected manually and also corresponds to “normal behavior”. Rather, it can be assumed that this is an intentional violation of the law that is supported by automation. In this sense, the initiator of the transfer is knowingly the person issuing the warning.

*2. The damage caused*

A claim for damages that is supposed to be derived from a claim for pain and suffering is not presented credibly.

The underlying judgment of 3 O 17493/20 from LG Munich I is based on the individual case presented in the judgment and cannot be declared to be generally valid. The ECJ made it clear in case C-300/21 on October 6, 2022 that the mere violation of the provisions of the GDPR does not give rise to a claim for damages. Rather, the plaintiff must demonstrate and prove (significant) material and/or immaterial damage. “Annoyance” over a violation of the GDPR is not sufficient to assume immaterial damage.

In addition, this deliberate and massively repeated behavior raises the question of the extent to which the IP address used by the person issuing the warning on the Internet was already known to Google and what damage can be claimed for further transmissions of the IP address.

**How high is my risk?**

In the unlikely event of a lawsuit, the claim for payment, which is not very high anyway, can be recognized in court by accepting additional costs that are based on the amount of the lawsuit. If you are explicitly sued, you should seek legal advice.

**Conclusion**

From our point of view, the risk is low. The idea of a warning is bold. We don't see any reason to act because the actions are obviously commercial and aimed at making a profit. The actions of those involved violate good faith and it remains to be seen to what extent this action will have legal repercussions - including for the lawyers involved.

We will continue to monitor the situation. If you need support - we are there for you.
