### Summary of service

This is an electronic platform where prospective investors can browse investment opportunities and make investments from among those opportunities. Prospective investors can also participate in blogs and chat rooms, read educational materials, and take advantage of other features that we might add from time to time. We refer to what we do on the Site as the “Service.”

We refer to anyone who uses the Site, even just to browse, as a “User.”

We refer to the images, text, and other content you see on the Site as “Content.” On some parts of the Site, Users can upload Content.

### Acceptance of terms; Changes in terms

If you use the Site, even just to browse, you will be deemed to have consented to the terms of this Agreement. We may also ask you to indicate your consent more formally by checking a box or otherwise taking an affirmative action.

The Service is offered subject to acceptance of all of the terms and conditions contained in these Terms of Use and all other operating rules, policies, and procedures we may publish on the Site, which are incorporated by reference.

The Company may, at its sole discretion, modify or replace these Terms of Use by posting the updated terms on the Site. Unless otherwise indicated by the Company, any changes will become effective on a prospective basis from the date of posting. It is your responsibility to check the Terms of Use periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to the Terms of Use constitutes acceptance of those changes.

The Company reserves the right to change, suspend, or discontinue the Service or any of its features at any time for any reason. The Company may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Service without notice or liability.

### **Relationship to privacy policy and other contracts**

Our Privacy Policy is part of this Agreement.

In addition, we may ask that you agree to other terms and conditions depending on your use of the Site. For example, investors considering investments under Title III of the JOBS Act will be asked to agree to supplemental Terms of Use. All of such other terms and conditions become part of this Agreement.

There are no agreements or understandings concerning your use of the Site that are not reflected in this Agreement or in the other documents that refer to this Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and the Company with respect to the Service.

- Any claim, dispute, or controversy arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Site or our Services, Privacy Policy, or Terms of Use that you may have against the Company, other than Excluded Claims (as defined below), shall be resolved exclusively by arbitration, rather than through the court system.

### Supplemental terms of use for Title III (Regulation Crowdfunding) opportunities.

You have expressed interest in one or companies offering securities under section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act of 1933, which was added to the law by the JOBS Act of 2012. We refer to those as “Title III Opportunities.”

These Supplemental Terms of Use for Title III Opportunities – which we refer to as the “Supplemental Terms” – apply to all Title III Opportunities. They supplement, but do not replace the Terms of Use, meaning that you continue to be subject to all of the Terms of Use. However the Supplemental Terms conflict with the Terms of Use, these Supplemental Terms take precedence.

The following definitions apply in these Supplemental Terms:

- The words “Funding Portal,” “we,” or ”us” mean Not So Small Change, LLC.
- “You” means you, the prospective investor.
- “Site” means the website located at http://www.smallchange.co/.
- “Issuers” means the companies offering securities at the Site under section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act of 1933, which are designated as such at the Site.
- “SEC” means the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
- “FINRA” means the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
- Other capitalized terms have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Use.

You agree that:

**Accuracy of Information**. All of the information you provide to us will be true and accurate in all respects. If you learn that any of the information you have given to us is incorrect or inaccurate, you will notify us immediately.

**Role of Portal**. You understand that Funding Portal is a “funding portal” as described in section 3(a)(80) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and section 4A(a)(1)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933. This means, among other things, that:

- You cannot purchase securities of Funding Portal on the Site, and you will not acquire any ownership interest in Funding Portal by investing in an Issuer.
- Funding Portal does not make any promises, representations, or recommendations about any of the Issuers. You have to decide whether to invest in Issuers on your own, based on information from the Issuers themselves.
- All of the information about Issuers that you see on the Site has been provided by the Issuers themselves, not by Funding Portal. Funding Portal does not provide and is not responsible for any of the information about Issuers posted on the Site.
- Any contract you enter into with an Issuer is solely between you and the Issuer, and does not involve Funding Portal. Funding Portal does not guaranty that any Issuer will satisfy is contractual obligations to you.
- 

**No Guaranty**. Funding Portal is not making any guaranties to you. If you lose all or part of your investment, you will not have a right to recover from Funding Portal, except to the extent Funding Portal is determined to be liable for your loss under Federal securities laws.

**Need for Investigation**. Although we perform certain background checks on Issuers, and Issuers provide certain information about themselves on the Site, it is possible that (i) Issuers will be non-viable or even fraudulent, or (ii) Issuers will fail to provide all material information about themselves. We strongly suggest that before making any investment, your conduct your own investigation, together with professional advisors.

**No Approval by SEC**. Neither the SEC nor any state securities regulator has approved any of the Title III Opportunities list at the Site. Any statement to the contrary is a criminal offense.

**Resolution of Disputes**. Any dispute between us shall be resolved by FINRA arbitration, in accordance with FINRA’s Code of Arbitration Procedure. You shall not bring or participate in a putative or certified class action against us.

**Amendments**. We may revise these Supplemental Terms at any time. Any revisions will apply prospectively.

**Titles and Captions**. All article, section and paragraph titles and captions contained in these Supplemental Terms are for convenience only and are not deemed a part of the context hereof.
